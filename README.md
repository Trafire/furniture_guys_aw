Test Project for Interview Based on the second example in the form, it uses Django for the backend and react for the front end.

We want to have a job posting site that benefits both employers and candidates. An employer cannot publish as many advertisements as he wants and only 10 are active at the same time, the ad is simple text (description), but there are categories for the type of profession: QA, Developer, Manager, DevOps, PM. The employer must have an account in the system. The applicant does not have an account, but if he / she decides to apply for a particular advertisement, a record must be created with the following characteristics: Names of the candidate and on which advertisement he / she applies. A candidate can be tried on all the ads, but only once. Also make a reference (backend) that shows how many active listings we have by category and how many people have applied for each profession (QA, Developer, Manager, DevOps, PM).
